# The docker-compose.yml file describes the services that make your app. In
# this example those services are a web server and database. The compose file
# also describes which Docker images these services use, how they link
# together, any volumes they might need mounted inside the containers. Finally,
# the docker-compose.yml file describes which ports these services expose.
